Ima 18 year old rapper from Chicago 🌃 Im chasing my dream, it would be a blessing if somebody check out and give feedback on my newest song THANK YOU 🙏🏽
ewwwwwwwww
I thought that the Queen flopped!!!! We love nicki Minaj 💓💓💓💓
Y’all need to grow up
Latin Song Chart history? That's a stretch😂 Who on there though? 64 year old Evy Queen lol
Das tuff, i thought she retired LMAOO
and hopefully the last
nigga that is a made up achievement stfu
ok
She built like a bowling pin 🎳
NOBODY CARES. ESPECIALLY IF ITS NICKI MINAJ🤡
That shi hits different on mute 🔥
For ppl confused, Billboard has a separate Latin songs chart too. This song topped that chart. Also she retired from her own music, meaning she won’t be releasing her own singles anytime soon, but will still be doing features.
At This Point They Just Coming Up With New Records that we wouldn't even think of
At least give Karol g credit dick riding ass bitch
bro I thought she retired from making music
I thought she retired 😂😂
This how ESPN look talking about James Harden 😂💀💀
Bruh I swear they can make a stat for anything.
Wasnt she retired or sum shit

He finna come out with a rich British accent
He wont get pass 10th grade
He did say he wanted to go to college hopefully he comes out a new man 🙏
Not hating big Kodak fan but he said that last tome
A degree in prison is the same thing as a pile of dog shit. It’s worth nothing..
His cell guard gonna be his professor💀
Gleeful

A degree in gangbanging
Thats not kodak...
